# LazyFS Tests

LazyFS is currently being tested in different ways to ensure it is doing what is expected, although we are constantly looking for new bugs. These are the test suites and scripts you can use to check LazyFS's correctness:

1. Unit tests

    ...

2. lfscheck
    
    ...

3. [jepsen-io/local-fs](https://github.com/jepsen-io/local-fs) repository

    ...

I am always looking for new ways of testing this system, please feel free to send me suggestions!
